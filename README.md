### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Nguyá»…n Tiáº¿n Khang, I'm currently studying Computer Science at Ho Chi Universty of Technology. 

ðŸ”­ I'm thoroughly interested in fields related to Machine Learning and Optimization, more specifically my fields of interests/research are:
  - Applied Machine Learning (in Bioinformatics and Computing System)
  - Numerical Optimization (various mathematical models and techniques)
  - Information Security and Privacy in Modern Computing Systems (in Real-time Systems and IoT devices)
  - Time-Series Analysis (especially with regard to Machine Learning)


ðŸŒ± In terms of personal skills:
  - I'm proficient in C++ (C++20 to be precise), which I very often use for algorithm design, competitive programming and some heavy and performance-focused works.
  - I'm also currently learning and practicing advanced Python, esspecially for Machine Learning and Data Analysis tasks, and to deploy some of my frameworks and applications.
  - I also take a keen interest in MySQL, MongoDB and Oracle SQL.
  - I also use C whenever I need to have a look at some low-level tasks. In the near future, I'm  considering Rust for knowledge widening.
  - Aside from being well-versed in Object-Oriented Programming, I also possess great skills in functional programming in Haskell and Python.
  - Though not virtuous in Computing systems, I have a firm background on Security and modern computing services.
